      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the
      Work privately and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. However, AquaQuokka and AquaQuokka only has the rights to distribute the mod publicly. 

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to edit,
      use, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may not distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, unless You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files.

      (c) You must retain the license of the unmodified version.
          

      (d) You may not include any version of the work in a 'pack', 'group', or any other form of collection.
      
      (e) You may not convert or change the purpose of the modification to be harmful, hurtful, or target.

   5. Branding.
   Always brand your mod under the PEMCE name, but make it clear it is not the original named work.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the original service marks, or control rights of the original producer/developer,
      except as required for reasonable customer use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. You do not have permission to give the users of your edited version any rights towards your mod or the original. They have no rights to change the mod in any way.

   7. Sponsors. Your mod will never be sponsored by the creator, and must not be advertised by any user.


   8. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the modified work thereof, You may not sell, charge a fee for, apply a warranty, any obligations and/or rights consistent with your work.
